  #Carrier, Tier 2
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CMXenoCarrier"/>
  ##Playing as a Carrier
  Your ability to store 16 parasites and 8 eggs makes you adept at managing the hive and its captures, you can also stay around the frontline with your pheromones to directly infect any talls getting dragged in by other sisters or stay on the backline by placing resin traps hidden under items and filled with parasites to catch unsuspecting victims.

  Carriers also have the best tackle out of any Xenonid caste which makes them good at keeping down hosts to then infect them with a parasite.

  Remember to boost your parasite production, plot down Egg Morphers on hive weeds and collect parasites from them, remember to ask Queen since they are limited!

  ##Parasites
  Parasites will die if not inside an egg or carried a carrier, if a parasite is on the floor or held by another non carrier sister, it will die after some time unless controlled. Parasites will climb into eggs or resin holes automatically if standing above one.
