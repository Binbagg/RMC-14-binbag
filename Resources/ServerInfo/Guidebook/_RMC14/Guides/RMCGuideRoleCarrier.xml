  Playing as a Carrier

  Your ability to store 16 parasites and 8 eggs makes you adept at managing the hive and its captures, you can also stay around the frontline with your pheromones to directly infect any talls getting dragged in by other sisters or stay on the backline by placing resin traps hidden under items and filled with parasites to catch unsuspecting victims.

  Carriers also have the best tackle out of any Xenonid caste which makes them good at keeping down hosts to then infect them with a parasite.

  Abilities:

  Emit Pheromones: Emits one of the three pheromones, strength of said pheromone is dependant on caste and does not stack with pheromones of the same type.

  Plant Resin Node: Places a resin node which spreads weeds across a large area.

  Plant Resin Hole: Places a hole on weeds which can then be filled by clicking on it with a parasite, it can also be hidden under debris such as wooden planks or metal sheets.

  Throw Parasite: If your hand is empty this will retrieve a parasite from your storage which is the main use, if you already have a parasite then it will throw one.

  Retrieve Egg: Retrieves a egg once the ability is used
