  Xenonids thrive by constructing a range of specialized structures, these have to be made by a member of the drone caste line using the Order Construction ability (image) ontop of hive weeds.

  There is a limit of each structure.

  1 Hive Core
  6 Egg Morphers
  6 Recovery Nodes
  8 Hive Clusters

  Hive Core: This is constructed at the start of the match usually by the Queen to designate where the hive will be located and allows other hive structures to be built. Once constructed it will provide bonus evolution point gain rate, energy to produce Lesser Drones, hive weeds, and roofing protection from skyfire and skyspit. If the hivecore is destroyed then a 5 minute penalty will be incured before another hivecore can be made, so be sure to protect it!

  Egg Morphers: Egg morphers act as a large egg that launch parasites upon any tall that enters its vicinity. Gradually produces and stores up to 12 parasites on its own which can be retrieved by Xenonids.

  Recovery Node: Recovery Node allows for Xenonids near it to be healed by a do-after. Only one Xenonid can be healed at a time.

  Hive Cluster: Hive Clusters emit hive weeds which allow other hive structures to be built around them, it also can be repaired with plasma if it loses any weeds or health.
