  ##How to play as a Parasite
  Parasites are unique from regular Xenonid gameplay, they are expendable and help infect captured hosts or can attempt to hide under objects to catch unsuspecting victims.

  To become a parasite you can use the Find Parasite ability as a ghost or click on a egg in viewing, if you have recently died you will have to wait to become one.

  Once you have become a parasite you can walk to the front and wait for your sisters to drag a cap. To infect somebody on the ground you must [bold][keybind="Use"][/bold] on them and wait for the do-after.

  Every successful infect you get will let you become a parasite again without the need to wait for a timer. You can also infect standing targets by leaping onto them, however if you leap from far away it won't infect them, only stunning them.

  ##Uncontrolled Parasites
  Drones, carriers and hivelords can all pick up uncontrolled parasites and use them to infect captures in the same way by [bold][keybind="Use"][/bold] on them, if your target is nested on a wall then you must walk up inside it with parasite in hand and [bold][keybind="UIRightClick"/][/bold] to bring up the context menu, then click on the target. 

  Uncontrolled parasites will die if not held by a sister and left for 30 seconds, make sure to keep them in safe spots such as on a host or in a egg morpher, you can also put them inside empty eggs to refill them or in resin holes.
