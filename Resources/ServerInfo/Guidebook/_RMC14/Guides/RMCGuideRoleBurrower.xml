  Playing as a Burrower

  Use your resin holes to fill them with a special type of acid that stuns any marines that enter a tile around it, this can be paired with stomp and multiple traps to easily capture talls on the frontline and backline. Burrowers can also make tunnels that allow easy transportation of hosts from the frontline to nests however they suffer from a slow plasma gain, it is suggested to work around recovery pheromones.

  Abilities:

  Plant Resin Node: Places a resin node which spreads weeds across a large area.

  Plant Resin Hole: Places a hole on weeds which can then be filled by burrowers special acid by clicking on it with a empty hand, it can also be hidden under debris such as wooden planks or metal sheets.

  Tremor: Causes targets in a large area around you to fall to the ground, works through walls and useful for escaping or capturing talls.

  Dig Tunnel: Dig a tunnel which can act as a fast travel point, you can also rename tunnels.

  Burrow: Burrow underground and wait for a short time, after which you can emerge by clicking on any tile around you to start unburrowing, if you unburrow ontop of a tall it will stun them for a long amount of time allowing you to capture them if alone and behind cades, this ability works through walls and the unburrow time is dependant on how far you click away.
