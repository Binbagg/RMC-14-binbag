  Playing as a Runner

  You are the fastest and weakest. Use your speed to transport hosts from the frontline and scout the backlines, you can run under window frames and tables. Use your pounce to slash or begin tackling marines, however beware of shotguns as they will kill you instantly at close range.

  Abilities:

  Hide: Hide under objects such as tables.

  Leap: Leap at a target, knocking them down for a brief moment and locking your movement a bit, can also be used for mobility.

  Bone Chips: Shred some bone chips at your target which will slow them down.
