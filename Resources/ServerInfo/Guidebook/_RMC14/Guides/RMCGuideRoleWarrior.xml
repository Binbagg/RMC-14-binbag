  ##Playing as a Warrior
  Being very different from Defender, you now act as a primary attacker by staying on the frontlines singling talls out, use your Lunge to grab talls and Fling them towards the hive, after you can tackle them to capture.

  Beware that you have a smaller armor pool than Defender and will be easy to kill if dragging a target after lunging.
  ##Abilities:
  - [bold][color=green]PASSIVE[/color][/bold]: Your slashes and abilities have lifesteal, granting you health upon hit.
  
  - [bold]Fling[/bold]: Fling a target backwards 3 tiles and damage them, will also stun for a bit.

  - [bold]Lunge[/bold]: Lunge towards a target and grab them, dragging will leave you VERY vulnerable and slow you down so be sure to know when to stop dragging.

  - [bold]Punch[/bold]: Punches the target, dealing a hefty amount of damage as well as knocking them back a tile.
