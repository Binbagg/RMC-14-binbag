  Playing as a Hivelord

  Being a superior drone, you are able to construct thick resin structures at a faster speed, beware of working on the frontlines as you are prone to dying to explosions and skyspit so it may be a better idea to work on the backlines as Hivelords are also fast on resin by using their resin walker ability.

  Hivelords are also great at tackling which makes them questionably good on the frontlines if any tall enters their weeds.

  Abilities:

  Plant Resin Node: Places a resin node which spreads weeds across a large area.

  Choose Resin Structure: Chooses what resin structure to make, to then be used by Secrete Resin.

  Secrete Resin: Secretes the chosen resin structure on any tile you click.

  Order Construction: Orders the construction of a hive structure.

  Transfer Plasma: Allows you to transfer plasma

  Corrosive Acid: Secretes a glob of acid on items to be dissolved, can be used on multiple items at a time.

  Emit Pheromones: Emits one of the three pheromones, strength of said pheromone is dependant on caste and does not stack with pheromones of the same type.

  Resin Walker: Grants you increased speed when on resin, however will quickly drain your plasma.
