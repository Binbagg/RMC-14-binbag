  ##Playing as a Hivelord

  Being a superior drone, you are able to construct thick resin structures at a faster speed, beware of working on the frontlines as you are prone to dying to explosions and skyspit so it may be a better idea to work on the backlines as Hivelords are also fast on resin by using their resin walker ability.

  Hivelords are also great at tackling which makes them questionably good on the frontlines if any tall enters their weeds.
