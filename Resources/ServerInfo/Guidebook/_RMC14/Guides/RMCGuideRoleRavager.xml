  Playing as a Ravager

  You don't need to hide anymore.

  Turning from a ambush caste to a slow brawler, they are very offensive on the frontline and excel at dealing damage by using their Empower on 3 or more targets to become super empowered which upgrades their Scissor Cut and Assault.

  Their passive include having their slash damage increased based on the amount of targets they currently empower from, being fire-proof and explosion-resistant.

  Your first activation of Empower will grant shield, on the second activation for every target nearby you, gain extra shield. It is suggested that you quickly Empower twice once nearby marines before unleashing the rest of your attacks.

  Abilities:

  Empower: On first activation, grant shield points, on second activation for every target in your line of sight and near you, gain extra shield. Empowering from 3 or more targets will make you super empowered, upgrading your other abilities.

  Assault: Lunge towards your direction, if super empowered you will fling, knock down and slash any target you hit. Slashing any targets will reduce this ability's cooldown.

  Scissor Cut: Slash in a 1x4 line damaging anybody inside, if super empowered whoever hit will be slowed.
