  Playing as a Spitter

  The Spitter turns from a harasser to now being able to go on the offensive, its slower speed is now counteracted by better health and damaging spits along with stronger Corrosive Acid.

  Its new poerful acid based abilities allow it to deal consistent damage at the frontline at range.

  Its unique combo is Charged Spit, Acid Spit and then Acid Spray, if used on the same tall it will stun them to the ground and upgrade the Charged Spit on them, this can allow for Spitters to tailstab them for free.

  Abilities:

  Acid Spit: Glob acid to deal damage to any targets.

  Charged Spit: Grants you extra movement speed and armor and empowers your next spit, which will do extra damage but will be shorter in range. Additionally, it will spatter the target in acid.

  Spray Acid: Sprays acid along the ground in a line, covering any barricades and dealing damage to talls.

  Will also extinguish any sisters if they are on fire. If used on a tall affected by Charged Spit, will upgrade the spit and stun them.

  Corrosive Acid: Secretes a glob of acid on items to be dissolved, can be used on multiple items at a time.
