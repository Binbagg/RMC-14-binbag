  #Spitter, Tier 2
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CMXenoSpitter"/>
  ##Playing as a Spitter
  The Spitter turns from a harasser to now being able to go on the offensive, its slower speed is now counteracted by better health and damaging spits along with stronger Corrosive Acid.

  Its new poerful acid based abilities allow it to deal consistent damage at the frontline at range.

  Its unique combo is Charged Spit, Acid Spit and then Acid Spray, if used on the same tall it will stun them to the ground and upgrade the Charged Spit on them, this can allow for Spitters to tailstab them for free.

  Reminder that charge spit extra movement can be used for escaping, as it lasts a while or until your next spit!
