  Playing as a Crusher

  Make use of your high armor pool and explosion resistance to protect sisters and walk enemies down. Crushers become immune to grenade stuns and get multiple passives.

  Your slashes will slow targets and deal adjacent damage to any targets nearby, they also reduce ability cooldowns.

  Abilities:

  Charge: Click on a tile to charge at, after a do-after you will bash anybody in the way dealing massive damage to them and reducing your charge cooldown.

  Stomp: Stomp on the ground in a AOE that stuns all targets nearby briefly, when used directly atop a downed target will inflict heavy damage.

  Defensive Shield: Gain a temporary shield that blocks and reduces damage, it also has a short timer of high explosive invulnerability.
