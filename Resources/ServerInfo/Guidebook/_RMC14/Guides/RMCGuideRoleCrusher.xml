  #Crusher, Tier 3
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CMXenoCrusher"/>
  ##Playing as a Crusher
  Make use of your high armor pool and explosion resistance to protect sisters and walk enemies down. Crushers become immune to grenade stuns and get multiple passives.

  Never charge into a horde of marines with no knowledge, you are very slow and will be vulnerable to SADAR as you have no escape abilities, this means you must play crusher with lots of info.
  
  To push in you should first start with a charge and defensive shield at the start so that your slashes can regenerate the cooldown, use stomp to disrupt marines while you slash them and then disengage.

  Your slashes will slow targets and deal adjacent damage to any targets nearby, they also reduce ability cooldowns.
  
  ##Abilities:
  - [bold][color=green]PASSIVE[/color][/bold]: Your slashes cleave targets, allowing them to hit multiple enemies at once in its direction for a lessened damage amount.

  - [bold]Charge[/bold]: Click on a tile to charge at, after a do-after you will bash anybody in the way dealing massive damage to them and reducing your charge cooldown.
